(this is still draft)

As I read through the docs for Jekyll and Bootstrap, I'm naturally going off on tangents and reading more about things that I haven't touched in a while and forgotten.

#### `<figure>/<figcaption>`

#### `<picture>`

#### `<progress>`

{% highlight css %}
    .clear:after { 
      content: ''; 
      display: block; 
      clear: both; 
    }
{% endhighlight %}


Also found some new stuff.

#### `<mark>`
#### `<summary>`
#### [Page Visibility API](https://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/)
#### `<fieldset disabled>`
I'm quite familiar with fieldsets, but the ability to put the `disabled` attribute on it and have that apply to the `<fieldset>`s children is pretty cool! I imagine there's a ton of JS out there does just this functionality.

#### `<input type="search" />`
Searching has become required functionality on most sites, so this provides cross-domain autocomplete for previously-entered phrase, as well as has the little "x" icon to clear the box instantly. More stuff that used to require JS but is now being done better by the browser.
