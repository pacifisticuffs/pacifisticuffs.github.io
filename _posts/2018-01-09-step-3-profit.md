I managed to install Jekyll without a problem. Following their [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/){:target="_blank"} made it a piece of cake to get going. The functionality and ability to customize your setup is really impressive and goes far beyond anything I will likely do with it. 

I've also settled upon a [theme](http://demo.themewagon.com/preview/black-n-white-clean-responsive-blog-template){:target="_blank"} I'll be using. It's pretty basic and simple. I need to pare it down to only what I really need, and make sure that I've got all its dependencies up-to-date.
